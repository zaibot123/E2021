Before I called her back, her brother called and told me that my relative was lying and not to give her the money.

I thought about it for a minute and decided to give her the $800.00 because we all need help at times. So, I called my relative and told her to come and get the money. A couple of hours later, I get a call from the County jail. It was my relative crying, screaming and asking why I gave her counterfeit money.
